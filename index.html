    <h1>PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="V">The success story of the inception, growth and blossoming of the Holy Cross Convent English High School, Amravati as it stands today is one that is replete with God’s boundless mercies and dedicated response of human endeavour. The tiny seed planted in 1887 has indeed taken root, grown and spread its branches letting the shade and fruits be enjoyed by the many students who pass through the portals of this institution.

        It is an honour and privilege to be at the helm of this great Institution that has lived its vision of providing integral and holistic education for the past133 years. Great minds envisioned education of the girl child and great hearts took this noble task forward without flinching- I salute those zealous missionaries who left all to give their all to build a bright future for all those who cross the portals of the school that stands for excellence and continually sets the highest standards.

        This endeavour does not end here; rather new avenues wait to be trod as the society evolves rapidly. Education shapes individuals in their formative years and imbues them with values that would govern all their choices in life. It is said ‘ If you are planning for a year, sow rice; if you are planning for a decade, plant trees; if you are planning for a lifetime, educate people.’ Indeed one can even say that the quality of education will determine the destiny of the nation.

        Dear ex-students, your Alma Mater is proud of you as you shine in the field of your choice and more so for becoming good human beings. Remain true to the motto of your school ‘ Lighted to enlighten’ every time you contribute to the building up of human and spiritual values; thus becoming sensitive to the needs of the society.

        We appreciate and remember with gratitude the important role played by our well wishers and benefactors in laying a strong foundation of democratic values for our nation through this esteemed institution.

        May all our efforts come to fruition and may our school continue to be a ‘Centre of Integral Formation’. May all the school activities lead to our vision of revealing the unfailing compassion and love of God to His children.

        May God bless all our endeavours.</p>
